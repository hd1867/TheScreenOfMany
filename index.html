            <p>
                The Screen of Many is a desktop app made to allow Dungeon Masters to stop having to lug around binders full
                of notes or open 18 tabs on their laptop every time they run a session. The built in note-taking software,
                combat map, music player, and codex mean that youâ€™ll never have to worry about forgetting that scrap of
                paper with the house rules written on it or that book that has that one monster you wanted to try out this
                session. The Screen of Many is also completely offline, so that your gaming experience is as seamless as it
                can be.
